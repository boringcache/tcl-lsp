# Optimisation Profiles

This directory demonstrates the five optimisation profiles and the output each
produces from a single input file.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `input.tcl` | Source file exercising the optimisation passes (O100-O130) |
| `profile_readability.tcl` | Output at **readability** — idiomatic rewrites only |
| `profile_standard.tcl` | Output at **standard** — readability + constant folding |
| `profile_full.tcl` | Output at **full** — all passes, single pass |
| `profile_aggressive.tcl` | Output at **aggressive** — all passes, multi-pass to fixpoint |
| `deep_pipeline.tcl` | Deep multi-pass stress sample — layered so each optimisation exposes the next (5+ passes, interprocedural folding). Runs on C Tcl 9; the optimised / formatted / minified forms all print the same line (see its header comment). |

## Profiles

### `off`

All optimisations disabled. Output is identical to `input.tcl`.

### `readability` (editor default)

**Enabled codes:** O111, O114, O115, O117, O120, O128 (6 codes)

Idiomatic Tcl rewrites only — no code removal or restructuring:

- `set x [expr {$x + N}]` &rarr; `incr x N` (O114) — the target must be provably
  `TclType::Int`, since `expr` promotes a float operand where `incr` errors
- `[string length $s] == 0` &rarr; `$s eq ""` (O117)
- `==`/`!=` on strings &rarr; `eq`/`ne` (O120)
- Redundant nested `[expr {...}]` removed (O115)
- Unbraced `expr` bodies flagged (O111, paired with W100)
- `end`-relative index rewrites (O128)

These suggestions improve clarity without changing the structure of the code.
They never delete lines or introduce new variables. **3 rewrites** on the
sample input.

### `standard`

**Enabled codes:** readability + O100-O105, O110, O113, O116, O118, O119, O129,
O130 (19 codes)

Adds constant folding and pattern recognition on top of readability:

- String build chains folded into a single `set` (O104)
- Consecutive `set`s packed into `lassign` (O119)
- Expression canonicalisation (O110 InstCombine) and strength reduction (O113).
  The sample's `# O113` stanza writes its expression as `return [expr {$r ** 2}]`
  and is **not** rewritten: no expression rewriter visits a `return` body
  (issue #1962). The same expression in a `set` becomes `$r * $r`.

Shows "this could be simpler" without deleting any code. Dead stores from
constant propagation remain in the output — the code is simplified but not
shortened. **18 rewrites** on the sample input.

Note what this profile does *not* do to the sample, because it is a **single**
pass: `set half [expr {$timeout / 2}]` still reads `$timeout`. Folding it to
`set half 15` needs the constant propagated first and the arithmetic folded
after, which is two passes — so those folds appear only under `aggressive`
below. The summary footer lists the propagations as O102 because they were
*found*; a hint-only entry is advice, not an applied edit.

### `full`

**Enabled codes:** all 31 codes, single pass

Adds dead-code elimination, code motion, and recursion transforms:

- Dead stores removed (`set stale 1` before `set stale 2`)
- Unreachable `if {0} { ... }` blocks removed
- Unused variable assignments removed
- Tail-recursive procs converted to `while` loops
- Loop-invariant code hoisted
- Single-use variables inlined

This profile changes the shape and length of the code. It was the previous
default for all surfaces.

### `aggressive`

**Enabled codes:** all 31 codes, multi-pass (up to 5 iterations)

Same passes as `full`, but after applying rewrites, the source is recompiled
and re-analysed to find opportunities exposed by earlier passes. For example:

1. Pass 1: Constant propagation replaces `$timeout` with `30` in expressions
2. Pass 1: Expression folding simplifies `30 / 2` to `15`
3. Pass 1: Dead store elimination removes the now-unused `set timeout 30`
4. Pass 2: The three consecutive `set half 15; set threshold 40; set route 42`
   are packed into `lassign {15 40 42} half threshold route` (O119)

The aggressive profile finds **42 rewrites** on the sample input against 24 in
single-pass `full`. It is the only profile that folds the arithmetic through:
`set half 15`, `set threshold 40`, `set colours {red green blue}`,
`set second beta`, and the whole `set count 0; incr count; puts $count` stanza
down to `puts 1`. Convergence is typically 3-4 iterations even for large
codebases; the multi-pass engine stops early when the source text reaches a
fixpoint (no further changes).

## Defaults per surface

| Surface | Default Profile | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Editor diagnostics (squiggles) | `readability` | Non-intrusive while editing |
| `/optimise` chat command | `full` | Explicit user action |
| CLI `optimize` | `full` | Explicit user action |
| MCP `optimize` tool | `full` | AI-driven, explicit |
| AI skills | `full` | Explicit |

## Design decisions

1. **O111 is in readability** — bracing expressions is an idiomatic Tcl best
   practice and pairs with the W100 diagnostic warning.

2. **Editor default is `readability`** — 6 non-intrusive hints with no code
   deletion. Users who want more can change to `standard` or `full` in settings.

3. **`aggressive` is a separate profile** — not a `--multi-pass` flag. Keeps
   the UI simple (single dropdown) and avoids edge cases like multi-pass
   readability (which would be pointless).

4. **Descriptive profile names** — `off`/`readability`/`standard`/`full`/
   `aggressive`. Self-documenting; no compiler background needed.

5. **Profiles resolve to `disabled_optimisations` sets** — all internal
   plumbing continues using the existing per-code filtering mechanism.
   Profiles are a configuration-layer concept.

6. **Individual O1xx toggles override profiles** — three-state logic
   (`null`/`true`/`false`). `null` means "inherit from profile".

## Regenerating samples

```bash
for p in readability standard full aggressive; do
    tcl opt --profile "$p" samples/optimiser/input.tcl \
        > "samples/optimiser/profile_$p.tcl"
done
```

The committed outputs are exactly what that loop produces, and
`samples_optimiser_profiles_are_regenerated` in `rust/tcl-cli` fails if they
drift — which is how they came to document the retired Python optimiser for as
long as they did (issue #1789).
