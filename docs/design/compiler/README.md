# Compiler design docs

Focused, high-churn compiler design docs live in this folder. Each file
describes one piece of the pipeline — how it works, what it consumes and
produces, and the contracts that downstream consumers depend on.
Technical jargon is allowed here.

User-facing compiler troubleshooting and how-tos live in
[`docs/kcs/`](../../kcs/README.md).

## Start here

- [common-semantic-compiler.md](common-semantic-compiler.md) — implementation
  contract for the shared semantic IR, value/cell/world SSA, registry
  boundaries, exact completion and trace flow, target-family lowering, and
  current backend contracts.
- [semantic-aot-optimisation.md](semantic-aot-optimisation.md) — default-off
  contract for guarded semantic AOT passes, mixed plans, materialisation,
  native numeric lowering, and Tcl's dynamic dispatch surfaces.
- [compiler-pipeline-overview.md](compiler-pipeline-overview.md) — stage
  map and fact hand-off boundaries.
- [compiler-systems-overview.md](compiler-systems-overview.md) —
  subsystem contract map for quick ownership triage.
- [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) — the classic algorithms the pipeline uses
  (SSA, dominators, SCCP, semi-pruned SSA, interval abstract interpretation,
  GVN, slot allocation, worklist dataflow), their **verified** original
  references, and how each is adapted for Tcl's dynamism.
- [precision-limitations.md](precision-limitations.md) — where the compiler is
  deliberately, or knowingly, less precise than it could be: what is imprecise,
  why it matters, and where the code is.
- [fp-sweep.md](fp-sweep.md) — the `cargo xtask fp-sweep` false-positive audit
  harness: what it runs, why it is dialect-aware, how firings are grouped, and
  where the paired regression tests live.
- [command-oracle-audits.md](command-oracle-audits.md) — per-command Tcl
  oracle queue, evidence availability, and registry verdicts.

## Pipeline stages

- [lexing-segmentation.md](lexing-segmentation.md) — token and command
  segmentation.
- [green-token-tree.md](green-token-tree.md) — **proposal** for a lossless
  token tree, error nodes, and incremental reparse.
- [syntax-tree.md](syntax-tree.md) — the canonical red-green concrete syntax
  tree (lossless, position-independent); the segmenter's byte-identical
  backing and the foundation the formatter, minifier, AOT lowering, and
  per-command tooling are migrating onto.
- [expression-parsing.md](expression-parsing.md) — Pratt parser, braced
  and unbraced expressions.
- [cfg-construction.md](cfg-construction.md) — basic block
  decomposition patterns.

  phi placement.

  rules.
- [lowering-dispatch.md](lowering-dispatch.md) — argument roles and
  command classification.
- [full-pipeline-walkthrough.md](full-pipeline-walkthrough.md) —
  end-to-end source to bytecode walkthrough.
- [control-flow-patterns.md](control-flow-patterns.md) — if, while,
  for, foreach, and proc compilation.
- [error-recovery.md](error-recovery.md) — ghost delimiter injection for
  malformed input: the recovery loop, the E20x heuristics, the structural-state
  index that vetoes inert insertion points, and the `ArgRole` router.

## Analysis

  and liveness.
- [constant-folding-type-inference.md](constant-folding-type-inference.md)
  — SCCP and type lattice.
- [value-transfers.md](value-transfers.md) — **proposal** for the
  registry's dataflow axis (issue #1943): one `ValueTransfer` descriptor per
  command replacing the per-command fold and `incr` arms in SCCP, its
  SpecTcl `cell_fold` / `destructure_fold` families, the soundness gates,
  and what changes for every analysis, optimisation, and diagnostic.
- [type-tracking.md](type-tracking.md) — the comprehensive value-type model
  (purity / first-use commitment, union nodes, container element types, the
  numeric tower) with its oracle corpus and phasing.
- [def-use-chains.md](def-use-chains.md) — def-use chain construction
  and consumer contracts.
- [memory-ssa.md](memory-ssa.md) — memory-SSA, alias detection, and
  versioned memory operations.

  ProcSummary construction.
- [frame-effect-summaries.md](frame-effect-summaries.md) — the per-proc
  caller-frame (`upvar`/`uplevel`) and global-frame (`uplevel #0`)
  effect summaries, their named/opaque/empty lattice, the method-dispatch
  widening, and the conservative limits.
- [interprocedural-call-site-seeding.md](interprocedural-call-site-seeding.md)
  — how a procedure parameter is bound to a caller-uniform literal, which
  indirect calls (`$cmd args`, callback prefixes, `eval $script`) count as
  call sites, and what withdraws the seed module-wide.

  priorities.

  current `rbpf` codegen ABI, event/framework capabilities, verified design
  issues, real-world use cases, and the production-kernel roadmap.
- [recursive-descent-depth-limits.md](recursive-descent-depth-limits.md) —
  why deeply-nested Tcl source could crash the analyser (issue #996): the
  depth-cap + generous-stack-budget model every recursive-descent walker
  needs, the inventory of guarded walkers, and the known gaps.

  class carrier (`ObjectHandleFacts`): the four maps that answer
  "what class does `$obj` hold?", owner attribution per VTA edge, the

  and the empty-seed fast path's three-part gate.
