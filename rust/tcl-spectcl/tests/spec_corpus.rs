//! **The `SpecTcl` corpus-validation harness** — every `.tclspec` the repo
//! ships, loaded, installed, analysed, and run through the sandboxed hook
//! host, plus the hostile pack that proves containment.
//!
//! `docs/design/spec-packs.md` states the guarantees this file turns into a
//! gate. Per pack:
//!
//! 1. **Load** through the real loader ([`tcl_spectcl::pack::load`]) with
//!    **zero unexpected notices**. What counts as expected is
//!    `spec_corpus_baseline.txt` beside this file — one accepted notice per
//!    line, regenerated with `SPECTCL_CORPUS_BLESS=1`.
//! 2. **Install** into a real per-profile registry through the real install
//!    path, then run the **compiler/analyser and the optimiser** over corpus
//!    Tcl.
//! 3. **Exercise the hooks through the sandboxed host** — `tcl-spec-hooks`
//!    with `HostConfig::default()`, so the shipped budgets and the shipped
//!    quarantine policy are what run. No script error, quarantine, or crash
//!    record may occur for a shipped pack.
//! 4. **Report** commands loaded, notices, successful/attempted hook calls,
//!    host errors, quarantines, and wall-clock load + analysis time, per pack.
//!
//! ## Why the packs are loaded one file at a time
//!
//! A pack is a logical unit, not a file, and nine of the eleven ports under
//! `docs/design/spec-dsl-examples/` declare `speclib tcl` (the other two are
//! `speclib tcllib` and `speclib f5-irules`, and `snit-type.tclspec` shares
//! `tcllib` with the external draft) — merging them would
//! produce one synthetic "tcl" pack that exists on nobody's disk, with
//! duplicate-definition notices that say nothing about any real pack. Each
//! file is therefore its own pack set here, which is also the unit the report
//! is keyed by.
//!
//! ## Why the ports are installed `-override`
//!
//! The shipped collision policy is *shipped wins unless the pack says
//! `-override`*, and no example port declares `-override` — they are ports of
//! shipped specs, so installing them naturally is a no-op and step 2 would be
//! vacuous for eleven of the twenty-two packs. The harness therefore reports
//! the natural outcome ([`tcl_spectcl::pack::collision_notices`], the
//! `collide` column) **and** installs with the override flag forced on, so the
//! analyser reads the *pack's* specs and the *pack's* hook bodies run. Both
//! numbers are in the report; neither is hidden.
//!
//! ## Corpus
//!
//! `samples/` is the in-repo corpus: 81 `.tcl` files and 15 `.irul` iRules. A
//! pack takes the corpus files that mention one of its commands — a
//! **word-boundary text match**, not resolution, so a vendor pack owning a
//! short generic name (`eda_mentor`'s `run`, `add`) picks up sample files that
//! merely contain the word. That over-selects rather than under-selects, which
//! is the safe direction for a harness whose job is to run the analyser over
//! more code, not less; the `corpus` column is therefore an upper bound on
//! genuinely relevant files, and the per-pack list below the table names every
//! one so the claim can be checked. For
//! a pack whose commands appear nowhere — every EDA vendor pack, and every
//! external draft — the harness **synthesises** an exercising call per command
//! from that command's own arity and argument roles, and the report says how
//! many calls were synthesised versus how many corpus files were real.
//!
//! ### The `tmp/` corpus is opt-in
//!
//! A box that has run the source-fetch hook has five full Tcl source trees
//! under `tmp/` — ~320 further `.tcl` files of real library code, roughly
//! fifteen times the committed corpus. Absorbing them silently turned this test
//! into a ten-minute sweep that then tripped its own watchdog, and it did so on
//! developer and agent machines only: CI checkouts have no `tmp/`, so CI never
//! saw it. The `tmp/` half is therefore behind an explicit opt-in:
//!
//! ```text
//! SPECTCL_CORPUS_TMP=1 cargo test -p tcl-spectcl --test spec_corpus
//! ```
//!
//! Without it the harness draws on `samples/` alone, which is exactly what CI
//! exercises and what `spec_corpus_baseline.txt` pins — the load, install,
//! hook-host and containment guarantees are all reached by the committed
//! corpus. The `tmp/` sweep only adds *more third-party Tcl to analyse*, which
//! is `xtask fp-sweep`'s job; [`MAX_CORPUS_FILES_PER_PACK`] says the same thing
//! ("the cap keeps the harness a test rather than a sweep"). The test stays
//! un-`#[ignore]`d in its fast, samples-only form; the environment variable is
//! the opt-in to the big corpus, and the report names which corpora were drawn
//! on either way.
//!
//! Set `SPECTCL_CORPUS_DIFF=1` to run the pre-#1940 two-unit path alongside the
//! shared-unit path and assert identical diagnostics and raw optimisations for
//! every corpus input.
//!
//! ## Containment
//!
//! [`a_hostile_pack_degrades_to_abstention_and_never_hangs`] is the negative
//! half: `tests/fixtures/hostile.tclspec` declares an unbounded loop, a
//! dispatch-heavy fold, and a body the engine panics on. Every test body here
//! runs on a watchdogged worker thread, so a hook that genuinely hung would
//! fail the suite rather than wedge it.

# be deleted from here — the baseline cannot silently rot into a wildcard.
#
# THE LOAD-BEARING FACT, and the reason this file is not simply a mute-button:
# `specs/` — the eight bundled EDA loadables, the packs an installed tcl-lsp
# actually loads — appears NOWHERE below. All 776 of their commands load
# without a single notice. Every entry here belongs to a design artefact under
# `docs/design/spec-dsl-examples/`, and each is a known, named gap rather than
# a defect:
#
#   `unknown property `object_class` dropped` (13 lines, all four external
#       drafts) — a REAL LOADER GAP, and the most useful thing this baseline
#       records. `object_class NAME ?-superclass {…}? ?-allow-unknown?
#       { method … }` is ratified vocabulary: it is in the frozen syntax
#       (`docs/design/spec-dsl-examples/README.md`, the field table and the
#       statement index) and it is a compiled-in `SpecTcl` self-spec statement
#       (`tcl-registry/src/commands/spectcl/blocks.rs`). `tcl-spectcl`'s
#       loader implements none of it — `object_class` does not appear in
#       `src/loader.rs` at all — so every handle-returning factory in the four
#       external drafts loses its method table on the way in. Nothing under
#       `specs/` uses the statement, which is why the gap survived the EDA
#       migration unnoticed.
#
#   `unknown flag `-readonly` on `option` dropped` (3, tcllib draft) — not a
#       gap: the draft says so itself at `tcllib.tclspec:288`, \"no field in the
#       DSL to lower `-readonly` into — written on all three options anyway\".
#       A marked invention, dropped exactly as the compatibility policy
#       promises.
#
#   `names a lowering hook` / `names a codegen hook` (6, the `foreach`, `if`,
#       `return`, `switch` and `upvar` ports) — deliberate. A pack naming a
#       *native* lowering or codegen hook changes how the compiler translates a
#       command, so the loader warns and installs it anyway. These five ports
#       are ports of shipped specs that legitimately carry those hooks; a
#       private pack getting the same warning is being told something true.
#
#   ``state_transitions` row … is not yet loadable` /
#   ``world_effects` row … is not yet loadable` (27, the `oo-class` and `upvar`
#       ports) — the loader's own words. Those two descriptor families are the
#       named, still-unimplemented tail of the schema; the ports transcribe
#       them because the ports were written against the *design*, and the
#       notices are the honest record of the distance left.
#
# Adding a line here is therefore an admission with a reason attached. Adding
# one for a file under `specs/` would be a regression in the only tier that
# ships.

/// finish inside `budget`.
///
/// A hook host is thread-confined (`Rc`, one VM per pack), so the harness has

/// runaway hook must not hang the process" from a claim into an assertion:

/// differ. For the hostile pack, three 250 ms budgets against a two-minute
/// watchdog leave no other reading than a hang. For the corpus sweep the
/// watchdog is a budget over an amount of work that varies with the machine and
/// with how much corpus was opted into, so an expiry there says "too much work
/// for this box", not "containment failed" — and reporting the second when the
