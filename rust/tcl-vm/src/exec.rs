//! The non-recursive (NRE / trampoline) execution engine.

//! The VM owns an explicit stack of **activation records** and trampolines over
//! it, mirroring C Tcl's `TEBCresume`. A proc call pushes a new [`Frame`] (and a
//! [`crate::interp::Vm`] call-frame) instead of recursing, so deep recursion /
//! `tailcall` / coroutines need no host-stack rewrite (steering §8b). Completion
//! codes unwind the activation stack: `Return` is absorbed at a proc boundary
//! (→ `Ok`), `Error`/`Break`/`Continue` propagate to the top of this `run`
//! (where `catch`, which invoked us via `eval_source`, observes them).
