//! `ValueOps` — the value seam shared across Tcl runtimes.
//!
//! The evaluation parallel of [`crate::expr::ExprOps`], lifted from "evaluate an
//! `expr`" to "construct/inspect/shimmer a Tcl value". The pure command logic in
//! `tcl-cmd-core` (string/list/dict/…) is written **once**, generic over a
//! `ValueOps` implementor; each runtime plugs in its own value representation:
//!
//! - the **bytecode VM** over `Rc<Obj>` (cheap clone; copy-on-write list ops;
//!   `try_append_bytes_in_place` is always a no-op so the caller copies),
//! - the **WASM runtime** over `*mut TclObj` (24-byte C-ABI object; amortised
//!   in-place string growth via `try_append_bytes_in_place`).
//!
//! Two deliberate contract decisions (see
//! `docs/design/common-runtime-emitter-architecture.md` §4d and the red-team
//! findings):
//!
//! 1. **Char-correct strings.** [`ValueOps::as_str`] yields a UTF-8 `Rc<str>`.
//!    Tcl 8 character operations use UTF-16-style code units while Tcl 9 uses
//!    Unicode scalars; [`string_char_len`] centralises that release split. A
//!    byte-oriented runtime conforms inside its own impl; the seam never exposes
//!    byte offsets. Byte-exact commands (`append`, `binary`) use the parallel
//!    [`ValueOps::as_bytes`]/[`ValueOps::new_bytes`] rung instead.
//! 2. **Copy-on-write is explicit, not implied.** The asymmetry between a runtime
//!    that can grow a buffer in place (when unshared) and one that always copies
//!    is encoded as the [`ValueOps::try_append_bytes_in_place`] /
//!    [`ValueOps::try_list_append_in_place`] capabilities (default: cannot),
//!    **not** as a hidden `strong_count` assumption.
//!
//! Coercion failures are a closed, runtime-agnostic set ([`ValueError`]) carrying
//! the canonical Tcl message, so a single shared body produces identical errors
//! across runtimes and `tcl-cmd-core` can lift them into its command error with
//! a plain `From`.
