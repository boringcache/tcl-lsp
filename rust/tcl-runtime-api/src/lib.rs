//! Family-B runtime contract — the state-mutation protocol shared across Tcl
//! runtimes.
//!
//! The emitter↔runtime contract is a *state-mutation protocol*, not a
//! value-passing interface: the runtime is a reified, mutable store (namespace
//! tree, frame stack, variable tables, traces, command table) that compiled or
//! interpreted code reaches into. This crate is the published contract for that
//! store — the completion type, opaque handles, the `CompileService` injection
//! point, and a set of small **role traits** generic over an associated
//! `Value`. It deliberately contains no implementations; a runtime such as the
//! bytecode VM (`tcl-vm`) satisfies it over its own value/storage model.
//!
//! See `docs/design/common-runtime-emitter-architecture.md` §4 (Family B).

// The value-less vocabulary (the completion `Code`, the generic `Completion<V>`,
// and the opaque arena handles) lives in the dependency-free `tcl-core-types`
// leaf crate. This crate's own only dependency is that leaf — the concrete
// bytecode artifact is kept out of [`CompileService`] (an associated `Module`
// type) precisely so a shared command-core crate (`tcl-cmd-core`) can depend on
// these role traits without pulling in `tcl-bytecode`. Re-exported here so
// existing `tcl_runtime_api::{Code, Completion, NsId, …}` consumers are unaffected.
